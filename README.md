# Carfew

## Fewer cars, more friends 🤝

## What is Carfew? 🚘
Carfew is a new, innovative ride-sharing solution for those who want to meet new people 👋. With Carfew, you drive to make connections and meet people who like the same things that you do.

Connect with others over a mutual in-app community and request rides with people who are going the same way that you are. Its hitchhiking for the 21st century 👍.

In future iterations of this app, we would like to make communities dynamic with Reddit-style comment systems. We'd also like to allow riders to share ride costs with their drivers. We're looking into a verification system for all members of the app to make sure you're only meeting up with awesome, legit people.

This is an open-source project! Watch this repo for future updates 😉

## Why did we build Carfew? 🚗
We all believe that climate change is an inevitable reality that we have a responsibility to do something about. Fewer cars on the road is one way to help curb those effects.

Additionally, we are interested in understanding city infrastructure and being good citizens of the city we live in, San Francisco ❤️ . Building an app that can help to limit the number of vehicles moving around the city will help make the air more breathable and make the streets safer for everyone.
